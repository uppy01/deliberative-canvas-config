# deliberative-canvas-config

This repository is for configuration files that serve to populate/hydrate the Deliberative Canvas App such that updates can be made without having to re-build/release the app and/or host a database.

It may also hold data/templates/outputs from deliberative tools that the app interoperates with - see [dt-output-examples](/dt-output-examples/)
